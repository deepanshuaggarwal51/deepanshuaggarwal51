- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Deepanshu Aggarwal @deepanshuaggarwal51. I am a Ph.D. student working on theoretical problems in Quantum condensed matter at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in learning various theories to obtain analytical results while simultaneously implementing them to write efficient codes for the various complex systems to dig out their rich physics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - Please write to me at daggarwal305@outlook.com.

Our first work was an invited topical review by JPCM on "A primer on twistronics: a massless Dirac fermion's journey to moirÃ© patterns and flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene," that starts
from the perspective of a massless Dirac fermion in various superlattice potentials. In this line, we reviewed the moirÃ© patterns in graphene over hexagonal Boron nitride and twisted bilayer graphene.
We showed the details of various effective continuum models like the Bistritzer and MacDonald model and its particular case of chiral symmetric Hamiltonian. In the end, we also provided
important theoretical and experimental works in tBLG and other systems like twisted double bilayer graphene, twisted trilayer graphene, etc.
